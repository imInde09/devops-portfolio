PROJECTS
Cloud-Resource-Logger: AWS Resource Management CLI Tool
A Command-Line Interface (CLI) for efficient listing and management of AWS resources.
Developed Cloud-Resource-Logger, a Node.js-based CLI tool for managing and listing AWS resources such
as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, Lambda functions, DynamoDB tables, IAM users, RDS instances, ECS
clusters, and EKS clusters.
The tool facilitates interaction with AWS by securely prompting for credentials and displaying detailed
information on various services. Key features include easy setup, clean environment management
(start/stop commands), and comprehensive resource listing via modularized AWS service logic using the
AWS SDK (v3).
The CLI is ideal for developers and cloud engineers seeking streamlined AWS resource management.
